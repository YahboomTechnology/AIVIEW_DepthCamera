# Introduction
AI VIEW depth camera is only 68.3*25.3*19.0m in size, compact and easy to carry. It combines binocular vision and structured light technology to achieve high-precision 3D reconstruction of objects in complex environments. The measurement range is 0.25-2.5 meters, with good resistance to strong light, suitable for various indoor use scenarios.

Advanced technology: AI VIEW combines binocular vision and structured light technology. Two cameras are used to capture the left and right views of the scene and calculate the depth information of the object. Structured light technology projects a specific light pattern onto the target object and uses the camera to capture the deformation of the light on the surface of the object to extract depth information.

Support ROS2 and AI function: We provide a wealth of ROS1/ROS2 and AI visual development materials, allowing you to quickly build your own depth sensing applications. Whether it is automatic navigation, object recognition or environment modeling, this camera can meet your needs.

Large field of view, high precision: AI VIEW has a wide field of view, allowing you to capture more details. Smaller blind zone of 0.25 meters ensures that user will not miss anything.

Compact Design: The compact size of this camera makes it ideal for integration into a variety of devices. Whether in robotics, autonomous driving systems or medical devices, it can be easily integrated into your application.
